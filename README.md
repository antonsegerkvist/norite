# Norite
This is a small game that is intended to resemble the game Transport Tycoon Deluxe.
The major difference is that the game builds on top of blocks rather than having
an isometric tiles.

## Dependecies
The project maintains a list of dependecies and and may or may not work with other
versions of those. The list is currently as follows:

- SDL v2.0.4
- OpenGL 3.3
- GL3W

## Further
I just spend some of my freetime developing this, so do not expect a rapid development
process.
